# ID_Assignment_ArcticM
A redesign of the website for the indie rock band, Arctic Monkeys. I have chosen to redesign their website as I am personally a big fan of theirs. This website covers their discography, tour venues, gallery, and provides a channel in which other fans can send messages to the band via email.

# Design Process
This website is for fans and general viewers alike, those interested in knowing more about the band or perhaps buying tickets for their future concerts can find such information in this webstie. This website lists their discography, as well as promoting their newest releases on its main page, ensuring all visitors of the website know about their latest project.

# Features
Main page
- Users can use the intuitive buttons to toggle between slides showing information about the new album
- By clicking "Learn More", users are rediercted to a webpage that gives them multiple options as to where they can stream / play the new album
- Icons at the bottom of the page allow for users to quickly access the profile of the Arctic Monkeys on any social media available

Discography page
- Users can click between different slides, or just allow it to automatically slide, to show past albums and their track listings.

Live page
- Users can directly access the website of the venues that will be hosting the Arctic Monkeys

Contact page
- Users can easily send an email to the band directly through a simple form
